HTTP-Server-Brick version 0.0.7

$Id$

HTTP::Server::Brick allows you to quickly wrap a prototype web server around some
Perl code. The underlying server daemon is HTTP::Daemon and the performance should
be fine for demo's, light internal systems, etc.

See the POD documentation in the module for more information.

INSTALLATION

To install with Module::Build, you can use the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Alternatively, run the following commands (Module::Build is still
required, this is just a wrapper):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


DEPENDENCIES

    LWP
    Test::More
    version

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

It's version 0.0.7 - there's bound to be some bugs!

The tests fail on windows due to forking limitations. I don't see
any reason why the server itself won't work but I haven't tried it
personally, and I have to figure out a way to test it from a test
script that will work on Windows.

No consideration has been given to SSL.

No attention has been given to propagating any exception text into
the http error (although the exception/die message will appear in
the error_log).
